# Pioneer Credit Robot Exercise (Simon Scott)

A simple (and quick!) implementation of the coding exercise.

A bit rough round the edges, but gets the job done.

### TODO

- Clean up the structure
- Store and display a robot trail
- Support multiple robots and tabletops
- Support moving multiple steps at once
- Implement a better way to display the status
- Implement iConsole interface and implement dependency injection to enable testing


### TO RUN

From command line:
- nuget restore
- dotnet build
